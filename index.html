        Fédération Cynologique Internationale standard Dog (domestic dog) The
        <i><b>Beagle</b></i> is a breed of small scent hound, similar in appearance to the
        much larger foxhound. The <i><b>Beagle</b></i> was developed primarily for hunting
        hare, known as beagling. Possessing a great sense of smell and superior
        tracking instincts, the <i><b>Beagle</b></i> is the primary breed used as a detection
        dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine
        around the world. The <i><b>Beagle</b></i> is intelligent and is a popular pet due to
        its size, good temper, and a lack of inherited health problems. The
        modern breed was developed in Great Britain around the 1830s from
        several breeds, including the Talbot Hound, the North Country <i><b>Beagle</b></i>,
        the Southern Hound, and possibly theHarrier.
